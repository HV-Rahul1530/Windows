# #Virtual Machine Networks Setting

#NAT
Communication Type:
Router(Internet)<-- Host OS <--[Virtual/logical Router]<-- Virtual OSs
Forward Communication is not possible that means router and host can't ping VMs

#Bridged Adapter:
Communication Type:
Router <--> Host OS <--> Virtual OSs
Everything can communicate with each other, its like putting a switch and connecting every device with it.

### 

#Internal Network:
Communication Type:
Virtual OS <--> Virtual OS
All VMs can communicate with each other but not the Host OS and router, that means no internet.

#Host-Only Network:
Communication Type:
Host OS <----> Virtual OSs
All VMs can talk to each other and host OS but not router, that means no internet unless the host is router.

#NAT Network:
Communication Type:
All VMs can communicate with each other and host OS using the internet of the host OS, that means they access external network using the IP of host OS.

# #DNS Server:

13 Root Name Servers(Maintained by IANA)
TLD(Top Level Domain) Name Server(.com, .in, .org, .gov, etc servers)
Domain Name Server
Public DNS(Google: 8.8.8.8; 8.8.4.4, Cloudflare: 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1, etc)
Working of DNS:

We purchase the tld like .com, .org, .in etc from a medium only like godaddy which acts as a retailer in the process

Godaddy provides the server which  we call Domain Name Server which is managed by godaddy and the .com is managed by its
TLD Name server

TLD Name Servers Record is stored in one of the 13 Root Name Server

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b9d57550-3f7e-43fd-91d7-c9e38f29ee9d/21fe7fdd-9dc8-45cd-83de-3dd17aa4f0df/Untitled.png)

Work of Domain Name Server is to hold the DNS Records:

1. A Record : Addressing Mapping Record(IPv4)
2. AAAA Record: Holds Record for IPv6 record of the domain
3. CName Record: Alias Name or Clonical Name : Forwards one domain or subdomain to another domain, does not provide an IP address or we use different names for the same website then we use this
server will search for [armour.wordpress.com](http://armour.wordpress.com/)[blog.armourinfosec.com](http://blog.armourinfosec.com/) --------------------------------------------> armour.wordpress.com-------------------> IP Address\
4. MX Record: Directs mail to an Email Server([mail.armourinfosec.com](http://mail.armourinfosec.com/) where armourinfosec is the mail server of any domain)
5. TXT Record: Stores string of text connected with the hostname often used for verification of the authenticity of a domain just like comments in programming.
6. NS Record: Name server record: holds the information about the dns server where all these records are placed, more at
[ns05.domaincontrol.com](http://ns05.domaincontrol.com/)(master/primary)
[ns05.domaincontrol.com](http://ns05.domaincontrol.com/)(slave/secondary)
7. SOA Record: Stores the admin information of a domain or the primary and secondary name server of a domain
8. PTR Record: Provides a domain for in reverse lookups.
9. SRV Record: Provides port number for a specific service running on the domain

Note: Hosts file contains information of dns records
this information gets mounted in the dns cache (ipconfig \displaydns)

### Location of host file

linux: /etc/hosts
windows: sys32\drivers\etc\hosts

=>nslookup -type=A ip/name
(types: A, AAAA, cname, ns, etc)
=> nslookup -type=any ip/name(for all records)

How to make a Main Name Server:

[1.In](http://1.in/) 'Server Manager' in Windows Server, click 'manage' on the upper right corner.
2. Click - 'Add roles and features'
3. Click - Next(default settings) - Next(default settings) - Select a server from the server pool - Next
4. Tick on the DNS Server - Next - Next - Install
5. Open DNS Manager --> Forward Lookup Zone(right click->new zone)
6. Make a main domain(new zone) name and give IP
7. Under main domain create subdomains and provide IPs for each subdomain
8. Now the nslookup/browser will look for the IP in the local DNS before searching in Public DNS.

All things below are possible with NTFS File System only:

Must have Windows Ultimate to do all these operations

Disk Management Settings:
Disk Partitions:
User Management:
Persmissions and all:
Right click folder: Properties: Security: Edit permissions
Admin can edit ownership at any time

Computer Management(search with 3-finger):
Local Users and Groups Management: can do every hell amounta shit that a system admin would want
Settings applied to the group will apply to every user in that group

Active Directory Domain Server(ADDS) in Windows Server: A central server to control and manage user and group policies

Distributed File System(DFS): To manage multiple servers

File Server Resouce Manager: To manage the files and resources on the basis of categories; like restricting use of storage upto certain GB using quota and using the filetype:extensions

# Web Hosting:

Types of Web Hosting

1. Self Hosted Server: For big organisation which uses their own server to host the websites; needs maintenance and dedicated employees to manage servers
2. Dedicated Server: Dedicated servers are used in relatively small firm whose traffic is about 1000-5000 visits per day; multiple servers are putted in a room each with their own processor and website.
3. Virtual Private Server: Same as virtualisation; a server is logically set to provide resources to different website on the same server.
4. Cloud Hosting: When multiple servers are used to host the same website for the security of the data. Virtual cloud server, cloud dedicated server are the two types.

Website Binding:

Types of website binding

1. Binding by IP: Binding same website with multiple IPs
2. Binding by Port: Same website on same IP but different port, multiple websites using the same port
3. Binding by Type: Same website on same IP but different protocol
4. Binding by Name: Search for similar name would direct to the same website; we have to list all the name though

IIS: Internet Information Services is responsible for doing all these operations in Windows Server

Binding by IP, Port and Type can be done using Windows Client System also for a lesser number of users

1. Control Panel - Programs and Features - Turn features On and Off - Tick IIS and IIS web : Turn all the features on
Browser: Search IP of Server
2. Network Settings: IPv4 Settings: Advanced: Give mulptiple IPs there
3. Now all the IPs will obtain the same default IIS page
4. Download HTML templates
5. Move templates to C:\inetpub\wwwroot
6. Open IIS Manager and do some shit yourself not everything would be written

FTP Server
Proxy Server
